### PSE–AURC Guided Windowed PCA–GP (Surrogate + UQ)
Calibrated surrogate for FRF/peak prediction under BLI and EO excitation; supports selective prediction with coverage guarantees.

### CEBAL — Cyclic‑Equivariant B‑life Active Learning
Active‑learning framework for mistuned bladed disks; leverages rotational equivariance and sector‑wise augmentation.

### CS‑PINN‑DRL
Physics‑guided deep reinforcement learning with cyclic symmetry; full‑annulus FRF prediction and efficient UQ.
