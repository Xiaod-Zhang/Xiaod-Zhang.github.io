### About
I work on forced-response prediction and uncertainty quantification for aeroengine components under engine-order (EO) excitations and boundary-layer ingestion (BLI) conditions. My recent work develops windowed PCA–GP surrogates guided by physics–semantic entropy (PSE) and risk–coverage (AURC), enabling calibrated, selective prediction of resonance peaks and HCF-related indicators.

### Research Interests
- Structural dynamics of bladed disks; mistuning and resonance under EO loading  
- Surrogate modeling (Windowed PCA–GP), active learning (CEBAL), and calibrated UQ (PSE / AURC)  
- Physics-informed ML, cyclic symmetry / equivariance, and reliability evaluation  

### News
- 2025 — Submitted “Physics–Semantic Entropy for Resonance-Peak Prediction in BLI Fan Blades” to *International Journal of Mechanical Sciences* (under review).  
- 2025 — “Reliability‑oriented cyclic‑equivariant active learning for HCF B‑life prediction of mistuned bladed disks” submitted to *Reliability Engineering & System Safety* (under review).  
- 2025 — “An Improved Finite Element Modeling Method for TPMS Structures…” accepted by *Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines*.
